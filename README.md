# InstaCart
 This website is a clone of instacart.com made as a frontend task for selection in Code Utsave web developer team. 
### **Tech Stack I will be using and reasons:** 
##### **React JS:** 
Since this framework is suggested it as the preferred tech for frontend, I will be using it, since I have a pretty decent amount of knowledge in it.
##### **Bootstrap:**
In most of my projects, I don't use Bootstrap, since its required connection to cdn is very slow and I can manage different designs with pure CSS3 or JS. But this one is preferred.
##### **Node js:**
If I get time to add some feature related to server, I will integrate Node js (Express) with the frontend using netlify as the deployment server.

### **Deadline:** 
1st October, 11:59pm
